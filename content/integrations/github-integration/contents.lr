title: GitHub Integration
---
body:

*GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 17.5 million repositories. These repositories are open to the community for public projects and secure for private projects.*


### What currently can we do?

Right now you can connect a GitHub repository with one Taiga project and generate a one-way communication (from GitHub to Taiga) to:

- *Change the status of an story, issue, or task in Taiga with the commit message*: you may want to read more about this feature in the article ["Changing elements status via commit message"](/integrations/changing-elements-status-via-commit-message/ "Changing elements status via commit message").
- *Create issues* on Taiga when they are created on GitHub*.
- *Add comment to the connected issues on Taiga when they are created on GitHub*.

In Taiga an issue is connected with a GitHub issue if it was creted by the GitHub integration. In the detail page of an issue on Taiga you can see a link under the subject to the original issue in GitHub.


### And what can't we do?

- *Dual synchronization*: currently the integrastion functionality only allow to recive messages fromt GitHub and Taiga can't comunicate with GitHub, so any changes you make in Taiga will not be reflected in GitHub.
- *Show commit links in Taiga issues*: If you name a story, task or issue in a commit message (by its reference number) a link to commit not appear in Taiga.
- "Sync current GitHub issues and comment when the integration m√≥dule in Taiga is enabled*: the integration only works with the futere issues and comments added in GitHub.

!! Integration will always take time so please be patient. If you need a specific integration and you feel ready to get a machete and get into the Taiga, please review our [API Docs](http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/api.html) and our FAQs about [how you can contribute to Taiga](/frequently-asked-questions/how-can-i-contribute-to-taiga/#propose-some-feature-or-enhancement "How you can contribute?").

### Second: Configure Webhooks in your GitHub repository

1. Click on *Settings > Webhooks & Services > Add webhook*
2. On that screen set the *payload url* with the *payload url* from Taiga
3. The *secret key* must be filled with the same content as the *secret key* from Taiga
4. Content type must be *application/json*.
5. Taiga currently listen for three different kind of *events*. Just check *"send me everything"* or just the events you want Taiga to listen for.
      1. *Push events*: changing element status via commit message
      2. *Issues*: issues created in GitHub appear automatically in Taiga
      3. *Issue comment*: issue comments created in GitHub appear automatically in Taiga
6. Press *Add webhook* button to create the new webhook
