        <div class="body"><h3 id="q.-who-has-to-pay-to-use-taiga?">Q. Who has to pay to use Taiga?</h3><p>A. Project administrators are responsible for payment. If your projects on Taiga.io are ALL free or if you have installed Taiga on your own servers, you pay nothing (Though please fee free to make donations to us via paypal.) If you have just one private project, you also pay nothing. Paid plans begin to apply once you are the administrator of 2 or more private projects.</p>
<h3 id="q.-i-am-a-member-of-more-than-2-private-projects.-do-i-have-to-pay-anything?">Q. I am a member of more than 2 private projects. Do I have to pay anything?</h3><p>A. No. Only the project administrator who created more 2 or more private projects has to subscribe to a paid plan. You will not have to pay regardless of the number of private projects to which you are invited.</p>
<h3 id="q.-are-there-any-restrictions-to-upgrading-and-downgrading-plans?">Q. Are there any restrictions to upgrading and downgrading plans?</h3><p>A. No. You can upgrade and downgrade at any time. When you are ready to make a change, just select the new plan to which you want to subscribe. We will ensure that you qualify for the new plan (i.e. that if you select the 2-5 private project plan, you don't have 6 projects) and we will process the change. You will see the change reflected in the next billing cycle.</p>
<h3 id="q.-what-is-my-billing-cycle?">Q. What is my billing cycle?</h3><p>A. You will be billed in monthly cycles depending on when you first sign up. So if you are on a monthly plan and start say on May 12th, you will be billed again June 12th.</p>
<h3 id="q.-what-private-projects-count-towards-my-plan?">Q. What private projects count towards my plan?</h3><p>A. For a private plan to count, you have to have created it yourself, or ownership of the project has to have been transferred to you. The first private project is always free. After the first project, all new private projects you create will count towards your plan.</p>
<h3 id="q.-what-happens-if-i-create-more-private-projects-than-allowed-by-my-plan?">Q. What happens if I create more private projects than allowed by my plan?</h3><p>A. You will be prompted to subscribe to an upgraded plan if you outgrow the private projects allowed by your current plan.</p>
<h3 id="q.-can-i-delete-projects-and-then-downgrade-to-a-lower-plan?">Q. Can I delete projects and then downgrade to a lower plan?</h3><p>A. Yes! You can delete projects. We recommend you export the project and save it locally before deleting them on Taiga in case you ever need to access it again.</p>
<h3 id="q.-do-imported-projects-count-towards-my-plan?">Q. Do imported projects count towards my plan?</h3><p>A. Yes. Any imported projects counts towards your plan as would a newly created project. Please be aware that we do not guarantee that a project created with a previous version of Taiga will be importable to the most current version of Taiga. You may have to install it to your own instance running the version of Taiga last used by the exported project, and then upgrade that instance to the latest version of Taiga.</p>
<h3 id="q.-how-many-users-can-be-members-of-a-single-private-project?">Q. How many users can be members of a single private project?</h3><p>A. By default, private projects allow up to a total of 25 members per project. If you want to increase the number of users, you can buy user upgrade packs in increments of 20 users. (?)</p>
<h3 id="q.-what-if-i-bugh-a-user-upgrade-pack-for-a-given-project-and-i-no-longer-have-more-than-25-users-in-a-given-project-can-i-downgrade-to-the-default-25-users?">Q. What if I bugh a user upgrade pack for a given project and I no longer have more than 25 users in a given project, can I downgrade to the default 25 users?</h3><p>A. Yes. You can downgrade at any time. When you are ready to make a change, just select the new plan to which you want to subscribe. We will ensure that you qualify for the new plan (i.e. that you don't have more than 25 users) and we will process the change. You will see the change reflected in the next billing cycle.</p>
<h3 id="q.-can-i-chose-a-currency-different-from-the-usd?">Q. Can I chose a currency different from the USD?</h3><p>A. For now, we only accept US$ Dollars.</p>
<h3 id="q.-how-and-when-will-paid-plans-be-introduced:">Q. How and when will paid plans be introduced:</h3><p>A. Payment plans don't kick in until May 1st, so from Feb to May enjoy FREE unlimited private projects on us! Here's what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step 1: Select the plan that best suits you and enter payment information</strong>
On March 31st, Project Owners with private projects will receive an email indicating the payment plan that would best apply to them (based on the number of projects on their account) together with a link where payment information can be entered. If you are not a Project Owner, you don't need to worry about any of this! Even after payment information is entered, nothing will be charged until May 1st.  Take advantage of the month of April to decide what plan works best for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2: Subscription starts!</strong>
On April 30th Project Owners who have entered their payment information and subscribed to a plan will be billed for the first month's service (May). Project Owners with private projects who have not subscribed to a plan will find that their projects will be inaccessible. To gain access, Project Owners can either subscribe to a plan that corresponds to the number of active projects or downgrade to a lower plan by deleting certain projects or designating their projects as “public.”</li>
