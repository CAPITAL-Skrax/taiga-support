<h2 id="our-code-of-conduct">Our Code of Conduct</h2><p>Help us keep the Taiga Community open and inclusive. Please read and follow our <a href="https://github.com/taigaio/code-of-conduct/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>Please read carefully <a href="https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back/blob/master/LICENSE">our license</a> and ask us if you have any questions.</p>

<h2 id="sent-us-your-feedback-or-questions">Sent us your feedback or questions</h2><p>If you want to send us your feedback or have some questions about how to use Taiga, please direct these to our <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/d/forum/taigaio">mailing list</a>. If it's related to our SaaS <a href="https://taiga.io">https://taiga.io</a> please write us to our support email <a href="mailto:support@taiga.io">support@taiga.io</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that you can find some help in our <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/support/">support pages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="did-you-find-an-issue-or-bug?">Did you find an issue or bug?</h2><p>If you find an issue using the app (UX or UI bug) or reading our source code and it's not on our <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issues?statuses=1,2&amp;orderBy=-created_date&amp;page=1&amp;types=1">Bug list</a> at Taiga.io, please report it:</p>
<ul>
<li>in our <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/d/forum/taigaio">mailing list</a></li>
<li>in the issue section of the appropriate repository at <a href="https://github.com/taigaio">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>send us a mail to <a href="mailto:support@taiga.io">support@taiga.io</a> if is a bug related to <a href="https://taiga.io">tree.taiga.io</a>.</li>
<li>send a mail to <a href="mailto:security@taiga.io">security@taiga.io</a> if is a <strong>security bug</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even better: you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.</p>
<p>Please, before reporting a bug write down</p>
<ul>
<li>explain why this is a bug for you</li>
<li>how can we reproduce it</li>
<li>your operating System</li>
<li>your browser and version</li>
<li>if it's possible, a screenshot</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it takes less time to fix a bug if the developer knows how to find it and we will solve your problem as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Localization Issue:</strong> Taiga use Transifex to manage the i18n files so don't submit a pull request to those files (except <code>-en.json</code>), to fix it just access our team of translators, set up an account in the <a href="https://www.transifex.com/organization/taiga-agile-llc/">Taiga Transifex project</a> and start contributing.</p>
<h2 id="propose-some-feature-or-enhancement">Propose some feature or enhancement</h2><p>You can propose a new enhancement to our <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/d/forum/taigaio">mailing list</a> or review and upvote in the existing <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issues?statuses=1,2&amp;orderBy=-total_voters&amp;page=1&amp;status=1,2&amp;types=6">list of enhancements</a> in Taiga.io.</p>
<p>If you would like to implement it by yourself consider what kind of change it is:</p>
<h3 id="small-changes">Small Changes</h3><p>It can be crafted and submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/taigaio">GitHub Repositories</a> as a Pull Request.</p>
<h3 id="major-changes">Major Changes</h3><p>Before contributing with a major change to Taiga it should be discussed first with the Taiga Team so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Please, contact us in the <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/d/forum/taigaio">mailing list</a> or via <a href="mailto:support@taiga.io">support@taiga.io</a>.</p>
<p>We have defined a concrete workflow for this changes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User Story</strong>: Send us a complete description of the functionality you'd like to develop, how it should work, for which profiles, as if you were writing a User Story. Please include some ideas of what would be a definition of Done of the User Story. The team will review it, decide whether or not it could make it into Taiga Core. If not, you can always write a plugin.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship</strong>: If accepted, Taiga team will help you, and a person from the team will be your contact in the development process. The Story will be visible in the <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/kanban">Taiga Kanban</a></li>
<li><strong>User Experience</strong>: The functionality will require some wireframes or ideas to be developed correctly. A good UX its an essential part of Taiga success. You should create a user experience proposal and the Taiga UX team will help you.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: The design should respect the Taiga style. Try to reproduce other areas of the site. The taiga design team will review this proposal as well.</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>: The last step is the development. Remember to add unit and integration test in <code>taiga-back</code> code and unit and e2e test for <code>taiga-front</code> part. We have the API well documented too in <a href="http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/">taiga-doc</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Pull request</strong>: Remember to add a good description and screenshots are welcome too. Once the pull request is done, someone else from the team will review the code to ensure that it fits with the good practices and styles. If it does, the PR will be merged and will be on the next Taiga release.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think you are not able to do one or more of the parts of the process, your contribution is still welcome, but we cannot ensure that it will make it soon into the Taiga core anytime soon. It will depend on our priority backlog.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot! It is really great that we could make Taiga better with the help of the community.</p>
<h3 id="contrib-plugins">Contrib plugins</h3><p>Taiga support contrib plugins to add or overwrite some functionalities. You can find some example in <a href="https://github.com/taigaio">our organization at GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="improve-the-documentation">Improve the documentation</h2><p>We are gathering lots of information from our users to build and enhance our documentation. If you use the documentation to install or develop with Taiga and find any mistakes, omissions or confused sequences, it is enormously helpful to report it. Or better still, if you believe you can author additions, please make a pull-request to taiga project.</p>
<p>Currently, we have authored three main documentation hubs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-doc">Taiga Setup/Dev documentation</a>: If you need to install Taiga on your own server, this is the place to find some guides or our API documentation and reference for developing from Taiga API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-support">Taiga User documentation</a>: This page is intended to be the support reference page for the users. If you find any mistake, please report or fix it.</li>
