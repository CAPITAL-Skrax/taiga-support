<blockquote><p><strong>Taiga.io Community CoC (Code of Conduct)</strong>
<em>Version 0.1</em></p>
<p>As contributors and maintainers of any Taiga.io project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.</p>
<p>We are committed to making participation in this projects a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.</p>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery</li>
<li>Personal attacks</li>
<li>Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
addresses, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Other unethical or unprofessional conduct</li>
</ul>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or

threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<p>By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of

<p>This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community (like our
mailing list, Google Groups, in Twitter, Facebook, etc.).</p>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting a project maintainer at
<a href="mailto:coc@taiga.io">conduct@taiga.io</a>. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.</p>
