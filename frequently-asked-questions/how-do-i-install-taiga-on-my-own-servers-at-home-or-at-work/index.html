        <h2>How do I install Taiga On My Own Servers At Home Or At Work?</h2>

        <div class="body"><p><em>Taiga was designed to be as accessible as possible, and can be set up on your own server. To make self-hosting very flexible, you have the following options:</em></p>
<h3>Developer Mode</h3>
<p>It's a manual process. You configure some services and it's fast a simple. This is ideal for those who want to play with Taiga in their own local environment.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/#_setup_development_environment">our documentation</a></p>
<h3>Production mode</h3>
<p>This is also a manual installation. The process is a bit slower and more complex, but will result in a solid, robust installation that can be used comfortably on a development server for internal use. As a system administrator you will need to have the knowledge to implement a variety of tools required by the system</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/#_setup_production_environment">our documentation</a></p>
<h3>Using Taiga-scripts</h3>
<p>To simplify self-hosted installation we also created an automated version of the developer installation mode using taiga-scripts. The process should go smoothly, but If something does go wrong during this automated process, you will need to fix errors by following the manual deploy process.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/setup-alternatives.html#setup-taiga-scripts">our documentation</a></p>
<h3>Using Taiga-vagrant</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/about.html">Vagrant</a> is a tool for building complete development environments. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of Vagrant, you can use this method.  Check out <a href="http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/setup-alternatives.html#setup-taiga-vagrant">our documentation</a></p>
