        <h2>What&#39;s the difference between public and private projects?</h2>

        <div class="body"><p><em>For now, all projects on Taiga.io are private. Users will be able to select whether they would like their projects to remain private or allow them to be viewable publicly.</em></p>
<p>Taiga's community is made up of talented developers, project managers, designers working for both startups and Fortune 500 companies. We are now developing some very cool functionality that we think our community will benefit from. We don't want to give too much away, but some of the features that you can expect include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to search through the projects on taiga</li>
<li>Meeting the development teams</li>
<li>Understanding the scope of their projects</li>
<li>Diving into the details of what they are doing (on a read only basis)</li>
<li>Following and observing particular user stories / tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are creating a mechanism whereby valuable information can be exchanged, specific to the development process.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, we understand that some users require privacy.</strong> For those, Taiga.io continues to offer access to our tool on a free basis via the self-install option, or alternatively we will offer them the ability to continue using Taiga.io's hosted platform by subscribing to one of our (very affordable) plans.</p>
