*Taiga is growing fast and you may wonder how best to reach the right
Taiga team member to deal with your request. Here are the best
channels:*

I have a question and can’t find it in your Support Pages
=========================================================

Taiga has an active community, and others may have the same issue you
have, or may have resolved it already. We set up a **mailing list** on
Google Groups: `mailing list`_

If you have a question or issue that you wish to address privately, send
us **an email** and we will answer you as soon as possible. We have an
internal rule that no query go unaddressed for longer than 24 hours. We
are usually way faster than that. Email us at **support@taiga.io**

I think I found a bug on Taiga
==============================

Oh, thanks! We were looking for it but you found it first. Please,
report it in our `github issues`_. Your issue feeds straight in to
our Issues list on our own Taiga Project. This gets our immediate
attention and will wake people up if they’re sleeping (on the job
or otherwise). A team member will be in touch. We will hunt and kill
the bug relentlessly. It’s nice to feel safe in the Taiga.

I want to know what’s new with Taiga
====================================

We are continuously delivering new features and improvements. There are
two ways to stay current with the new features and bugfixes:

-  We post updates on our **blog** on the `announcements section`_
-  We have a **Changelog** file in our repo with every version. In
   `front`_ and `back`_
-  We tweet these changes as well `twitter account`_ Please Follow us!

I want to dive into your code
=============================

Great! Join the Taiga adventure. But be careful, the Taiga is a thick
forest, sometimes very dense and occasionally dangerous. It’s easy to
get lost. But if you are an expert we want you as part of the team.

Join the Taiga development community. Here are three points of
departure:

-  Check our `Taiga repo in github`_ Taiga is well `documented`_ so
   you can easily start playing with it
-  Our `API`_ is extensive and well organized. Adapt Taiga to your
   own needs.
