Taiga includes optional custom fields in its administration panel. It
will provide teams with a flexible input to fit in their workflow.

Users with administration permissions will be able to create new custom
fields for their project User Stories, Tasks and Issues

1. Configure Custom Fields
==========================

1. Go to one of your Taiga projects.

2. Click on *admin* button. *In this example we will focus on User
   Stories, but this feature is also available on tasks and issues and
   same steps should be followed to edit them.*

3. Go to *Attributes > US* and scroll down to the custom fields
   configuration.

4. Fill the name and description of your custom field. Remember your
   custom field needs a context for other users to understand it
   correctly.

2. Using custom fields

Once you created your custom fields, you probably want to use them. Go
to you US/Task/Issue and you will find a new area under the description
area titled custom fields.
