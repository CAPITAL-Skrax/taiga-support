Taiga import/export feature allow you to extract all your data from one
taiga and move it to another one keeping.

Exporting a project
===================

To export a project and download the “dump file” you have to:

1. Log into Taiga.
2. Open the Project you wish to export.
3. Click the *Admin* menu icon.
4. In the center menu pane, click the option *Project Profile > Export*.
5. On the right-side of the screen, click the green *Export* button.

6. If you are using tree.taiga.io_ or an asynchronously configured Taiga
   instance the export (dump) file will be generated by the server in
   asynchronous mode

   and you will receive an email once the export file has been generated.

   If you are exporting from a local instance (or non-Taiga hosted) which
   is configured to work synchronously, you will see this screen. The JSON
   file should be downloaded automatically, and if not, you can always
   click the *here* in the link below.

7. Your Taiga JSON file looks something like this (if you decide to poke
   around—please don’t!):

Importing a project
===================

Once you have a dump of your project, you can import it in other taiga
instance.

1. In your web browser, sign into the Taiga instance you wish to import
   the project into.

2. On the main projects screen, click the *Upload* button to the right of
   *New Project.* The button looks like an up-arrow with a line underneath
   it.

3. Depending on your instance (tree.taiga.io_ or an asynchronously
   configured taiga instance), you might get a screen that looks like this:

   .. figure:: /resources/admin/import-export-projects/import-export-screenshot-7.png

4. Click *Accept* and wait for the email similar to the example below:

   .. figure:: /resources/admin/import-export-projects/import-export-screenshot-8.png
      :alt: Import email

      Import email

5. Most likely, the import process will succeed and you will see the
   project appear on the main projects screen

6. Open the project and plan/develop/succeed as you did before!

Notes on Project Importing
==========================

1. The project import in taiga doesn’t migrate users, only project data,
   if you want to keep the users relation with the project correctly, you
   have to create the users before you import the project. Important, the
   matching of users with the import data will be done through
   case-sensitive email addresses.

2. If the import fails, please contact with support@taiga.io or ask
   through the `Taiga Google Group`_
